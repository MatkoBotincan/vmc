Verified Featherweight Multicore C 
==================================

VFMC (Verified Featherweight Multicore C) is a fragment of C enriched with
asynchronous  memory operations and fork/join primitives, together with 
function preconditions and  postconditions and loop invariants. VFMC aims to
serve as an experimental intermediate language for verification of multicore 
C programs. 
Poossible uses include verification for heterogeneous architectures with a 
host CPU and a number of accelerator cores (such as IBM Cell Broadband Engine)
or verification of GPU (e.g., CUDA, OpenCL) programs.



Building on *nix / Mac OSX
---------------------------

To run the build process, call: 
  $ make build

This will generate the following executable file for vfmc:
  ./bin/vfmc

To set the environment variables necessary for vfmc to run:
  $ . setenv

To run all of the tests in the examples directory: 
  $ make test 


Dependencies:

* OCaml >=3.11.1
